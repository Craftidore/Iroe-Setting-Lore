# Elves

Elves came from the Sky LifeBiome.
They are tall and skinny beings with proud attitudes. 
While in the LifeBiome, they genetically modified themselves to be mostly sterile. 
This worked excellently in keeping population size below the maximum for the resource-limited Sky LifeBiome.
When the Sky LifeBiome came down, the elves didn't keep their genetic modification equipment and now have trouble having more than 2 children. 
Two factions of elves arose in response to this problem: the [Free Elves](#22.02) and the [Wood Elves](#22.01).
