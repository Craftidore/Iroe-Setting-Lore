# Free Elves

The 'Free Elves' are moreâ€¦ lax than their [Wood Elf counterparts](#22.01). 
They, recognizing that the new world they found was *not* the Sky Biome. 
For all their clarity of thought, they have trouble sticking with a commitment.
Despite their long-lives, they have serious fear of lost opportunity.

## Genetics

Free elves, practically recognizing the limitations of their genetic inability to reproduce, carefully changed their own culture to encourage marrying non-elf species, especially normal humans.
