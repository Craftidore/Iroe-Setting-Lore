# Wood Elves

The more 'traditional' [Elves](#21.01), who believed that life, especially plant life, must be cultivated even at the expense of oneself. 
This isn't really a surprising view. 
Having come from the Sky LifeBiome, plant-life was difficult to grow given the constraints of a LifeBiome which had very limited resources as if it had too much weight it would be unable to remain floating.

Most free elves live in secluded forest cities, and avoid the world at large, a stark difference from the [Free Elves](#22.02)
