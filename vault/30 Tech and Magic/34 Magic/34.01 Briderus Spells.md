# Briderus Spells

Briderus spells are extra powerful, single-use spells.
Once a Briderus spell is used, the user forgets the spell.
In addition, even if you don't use it, it is also forgotten if it written down or told to someone else in its entirety.
Due to this, Briderus spells can't be learned from one single person.
Usually they are learned by learning individual syllables from separate puzzles, clues, or individuals.
Some Briderus spells don't require any magical affinity, simply saying the word taps into the world's magical energy and as such requires no check, but also can only do one single thing with no extra success.
Briderus spells aren't rare, but they are uncommon to learn due to their nature.
