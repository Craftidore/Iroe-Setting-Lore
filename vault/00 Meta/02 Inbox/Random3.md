Hope's (now known to legend as the Munao; and mistakenly thought that there was only a single one) 
and AGDs (now known as Orbs of Flight) are the two main things in the stories ab how the world ended

Those in 4098 also know of an ancient mother language that only a few scholars know. They don't know that that language is French.

0 NA8 is 2325 AD
