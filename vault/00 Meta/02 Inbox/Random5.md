Ok, I think (the law that made Magic illegal in Opralia) became official law in Opralia 5 years before Loi
The year was: 4058 NA8
It was all but official for many years before then. 
=======
Oclos Desert is located in Southeast (modern day Spain), the home of semi-nomadic cat-folk
The unofficial center of the magic-using world is Pegro, north of the Oclos Desert
The Order of the Wielders of Magic (OWM) is headquartered in Pegro, led by a council of 12 members, sometimes known to over-regulate use of magic.
Magic banned in Opralia in 4058 NA8
