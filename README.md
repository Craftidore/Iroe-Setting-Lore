# Iroe Setting Lore

This is a repo to store all the information about the fictional [RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game) world of 'Iroe'.
I set a number of my own Campaigns in this setting, but originally decided to make this repo so that my players can access the information.
However, I'd love if this campaign setting got adopted by more than just my RPG group, so if you want to use (or just pull ideas from) this setting, feel free. 
I'm listing it with a [CC BY-NC license](#license), so you're free to copy, reuse, or modify any of this content so long as it isn't for commercial purposes (and I am given attribution). 
Do note, this reference is still under construction and a *lot* of infomation is missing at the moment, so please bear with me as I finish writing this all out.
