# Wood Elves

The more 'traditional' Elves, who believed that life, especially plant life, must be cultivated even at the expense of oneself. 
This isn't really a surprising view. 
Having come from the Sky LifeBiome, plantlife was difficult to grow given the constraints of a LifeBiome which had very limited resources as if it had too much weight it would be unable to remain floating.
