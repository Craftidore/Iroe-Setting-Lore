# Geklian Gnomes

Geklian gnomes are considered the anomoly of gnome culture. 
Most people who've met a gnome have known a Wanderer Gnome [[ 22.04]], which are known for their joviality and compassion.
Most gnomes, who aren't struck with the Wanderlust [[ 22.05]], are as heartless as humans.
These other gnomes enslaved all the Geklian gnomes.

Geklian gnomes' most distinguishing feature is their black eyes.
They are also generally shorter and have sharper features.

Geklian gnomes are as succeptable to The Wanderlust, but as almost all of them are enslaved by other gnomes, few are actually able to escape and wander the world.
