# Wandering Gnomes

Gnomes struck by The Wanderlust are referred to as Wandering Gnomes.
Wandering Gnomes represent the public image of gnomes—jovial, energetic, compassionate, and a bit flighty.
They are abhored at the horrible slavery of the Geklian Gnomes [[ 22.03]] but aren't able to fight back against the entire weight of gnome culture nor to resist their desire to travel.

The Wanderlust (and thus Wandering Gnomes) aren't restricted to a particular subspecies of gnomes—all gnomes are afflicted equally—but Geklian gnomes rarely escape their captivity to wander the world.
