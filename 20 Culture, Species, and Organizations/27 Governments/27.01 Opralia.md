The Opralian people prize artistic expression to a ridiculous degree.
The nobles of the country search far and wide for the best of the best artists in the land, become their 'patrons' and bringing them into their care. 
Artists with noble patrons live the dream, staying at noble houses as permanent honored guests and given all the artistic supplies and tools they could ever want.
