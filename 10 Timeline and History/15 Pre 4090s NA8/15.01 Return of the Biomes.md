# Return of the Biomes

Around 1100 NA8, the SkyBiome fell, joining the MotherBiome.
The CoreBiome returned to the surface shortly after.
The CoreBiome, naturally contained what are now called Dwarves while the SkyBiome.
Some small enclaves of the MotherBiome contained people who had mutated in very similar ways, creating Orcs, Gnomes, and the other races.
