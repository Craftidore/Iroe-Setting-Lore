<p>The Moonstriker Assassins, founded in <strong>4026</strong> <a href="?page=NA8">NA8</a>
by Taeral and Ayen Moonstriker, a husband and wife. The small operation
grew to 10 people by <strong>4036</strong>, then around 30 (all elves)
by <strong>4056</strong>. Amidst this growth, a number of the original
members retired (or were killed). Furthermore, the original founders
were (violently) usurped by their children: the triplets Zatanna and her
brothers, Zelix and Zenith, beginning the golden years for the
Moonstrikers.</p>
<p>During their golden years, the three triplets branched out. While the
Moonstrikers had previously been elf-only (not because of speciesism,
merely as a result of Taeral and Ayen only really knowing elvish
assassins), the triplets put a strong focus on hiring diverse species,
backgrounds, and skillsets. With the ability to use the best assassin
for the job, the Moonstriker assassins became world-famous, renowned for
their competence and dedication to getting a job done. By
<strong>4086</strong>, the organization had grown to over 100 members,
and the triplets no longer personally led the hiring process.</p>
<p>The golden years couldn't last forever, and in <strong>4097</strong>
Zenith and Zelix had a falling out: Zenith decided the organization was
becoming too stagnant under Zelix and Zatanna's leadership &amp; decided
to break off from the Moonstrikers with the employees loyal to him after
threatening to kill Zelix if he didn't let him leave. Zelix took great
exception, believing they could only be strong together, told his
brother to stay with the Moonstrikers on pain of death. This became a
full-on civil war right as Zatanna, who had been out traveling and
returned to the Moonstriker's base of operations. When Zatanna, after
talking to Zelix and trying to talk to Zenith to hear his side of the
story, was then caught in a raid by Zenith on Zelix's forces. In a
last-ditch attempt to save the lives of countless Moonstriker assassins
as well as some non-assassins who were visiting the Moonstrikers to
request their assistance, Zatanna and an <a

sacrificed themselves fighting off Zenith's forces.</p>
