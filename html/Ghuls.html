<p>Ghuls are a race of corpse-eaters who live in the <a href="?page=Deadlands">Deadlands</a>. Most
live in extensive burrows underground, coming into the daylight
primarily for raids on other burrows or scavenging, but even then they
do everything they can get away with at night.</p>
<p>The Ghuls, as a tribal species living in lands of relative scarcity,
have a high respect for the warriors and hunters in the tribe. Even the
Ghuls who aren't "warriors" by trade still have strong fighting
instincts and frequently resort to violence as a solution.</p>
