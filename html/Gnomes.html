<p>Gnomes of Iroe are not your typical tinkerers. They fall much more
frequently into the malevolent trickster category, actively causing
trouble for others for their own pleasure. They usually stay in their
own isolated communities, unwilling to assist outsiders and actively
making the lives of any who wander near their village awful through
their tricks. Their society is typically built around slavery of other
gnomes for menial labor, while the smaller middle and upper class enjoy
lives of luxury. There exists another kind of gnome though; gnomes
afflicted by the <a href="#Wanderlust">Wanderlust</a>. For all the
horrible traits of gnomes, the general populace's view of them is much
more charitable; gnomes without the <a href="#Wanderlust">Wanderlust</a>
almost never leave their isolationist villages, most of whom are in the
gnomelands, which means the typical Iroian's mental picture of a gnome
is of one struck with Wanderlust.</p>
<p>Gnomes live an average of 100 years, with the generally accepted
lifespan limit at 120. They tend toward the slightly plumper side, with
heights ranging from 2.5-4 feet tall.</p>
<h2 id="wanderlust">Wanderlust</h2>
<p>The Wanderlust is a mental condition that afflicts gnomes seemingly
at random. It causes an urgent <em>need</em> for the unknown and novel,
causing them to <em>wander</em> the world. These gnomes, typically
nomadic though sometimes grabbing jobs that let them explore or meet
people from diverse cultures, create the mental picture most people have
of gnomes, due to the excess isolationism normal gnome communities
exhibit. Wanderlust-afflicted gnomes, known better as
<a href="?page=Wandering-Gnomes">Wandering-Gnomes</a> also tend to exhibit much more compassion than the
typical gnome (though this isn't a hard rule, but a noticable
generalization); whether this is caused by greater exposure to other
cultures and ways of thinking, or if it is a physical effect of the
Wanderlust remains unknown.</p>
