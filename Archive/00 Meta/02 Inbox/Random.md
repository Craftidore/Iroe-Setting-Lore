This story takes place in the year 2325 AD. Several important things have happen
ed between now and then. First, World War VIII has just been completed (in which
 France was conquered by a new country called Naputo). Second, the English langu
age has gone extinct. Third, gravity-weakening devices have been invented. They 
are spheres which can have a certain amount of mass input. A field will expand f
rom the sphere until that quantity of mass is encompassed and within that field 
the gravitational force is modified by some amount anywhere from 0.01-0.99 times
 the amount of original force.

Only 500 French people survived the war, and they want a new homeland. After som
e careful plotting, they decide they will take their fleet of flying boats and f
ly across the Atlantic Ocean to try and take over a small coastal country in wha
t used to be Brazil, called Wendellfrit- zia. Wendellfritzia remained neutral th
roughout the war but had been secretly building up its armed forces. Its scienti
sts had recently invented large, mounted disintegration guns called hopes (a mea
ningless word to them), all of which they mounted on huge floating fortresses ab
ove their land and ocean. 

On their wooden, pirate-esque, anti-gravity device (AGD)/jet powered boats, the 
French are on their way to take over this country and make it New France. The da
y before the French are set to launch their surprise attack, a young private nam
ed Pierre, faced with the daunting task of the dishes of 500 people, did not pro
perly wash off the soap. As punishment for delaying the attack, Pierre is left o
n a small island to be retrieved after the battle. The French first attack the o
ffshore floating fortress, whose existence surprises them. The fight goes well f
or the French, until the Wendellfritzians decide to test their hopes. All the Fr
ench are captured or fall into the ocean, their boats having disappeared from un
der them. Pierre is the last Frenchman. 

Despite not yet knowing this, he decides to use a malfunctioning AGDJ (anti-grav
ity device with jet) left behind and a raft pieced together on the island to joi
n the war. He slowly makes his way to shore until he approaches the first fortre
ss. When he gets near the fortress, it explodes and falls into the ocean. Confus
ed, he continues onward. At every fortress he approaches, the same thing happens
. The president of Wendellfritzia decides to evacuate the country, Pierre frees 
his remaining countrymen, and over the next 300 years New France uses the techno
logy of the hope to take over much of the world.

Why did the fortresses explode and Wendellfritzia lose the war? All their hopes 
were built on castles in the air.

New France went on the “conquer the world,” however they caused a nuclear winter
 which was the apocalypse.
