# The Other Worlders

While the Other Worlders don't have any official name (at least not one that's *known*),
they are slowly growing in their influence over the world. 
In a time long before the first age, a group of mad scientists opened a portal to what they believed was another world.
The Other Worlders were unfortunately mistaken; they had merely opened a portal into the futureâ€”the *very* distant future. 

The Other Worlders quickly realized their technology was much superior to that of Iroe. 
Hoping to utilize this advantage to gain power they'd never have on old Earth, 
the Other Worlders have chosen to take the route of conquerors.
