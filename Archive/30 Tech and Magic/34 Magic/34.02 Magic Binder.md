# Magic Binders

Magic binders can theoretically come in many forms: magic rope, a badge, a helmet, etc. Even a powerfully enchanted room. What makes magic binders what they are is that they use powerful enchantments to prevent the wearer from casting any spells. There are few instances of anyone being able to overpower this magic, and they're likely nothing more than rumors.
