Old Earth had 5 LifeBiomes:
1. MotherBiome (normal above ground)
    Was contaminated with radiation poisoning but somehow some Post-Apocalypsers managed to still live in it until the radiation cleared up. It is unknown whether it was this world-wide radiation or the simultaneous onset of magical energy in the world that resulted in the rapid micro-evolution of the Post-Apocalypser humans into several humanoid species. Some humans, however, remained unchanged.
2. SkyBiome (floating cities)
    Their methods of going back down to the MotherBiome were destroyed in the World's End War. Only a portion of the radiation reached the SkyBiome, and the appearence of magic was also slower. However, without materials from the MotherBiome and CoreBiome, maintnence of the AGDs that kept their cities afloat could not be kept up forever. They survived for a millenia (by which time they became the modern-day elves), but after that over the course of a century, each of the SkyBiome's 20 cities fell tragically to the ground below. The only survivors of the SkyPeople were those brave souls who somehow managed to use gliders to return to the MotherBiome when they progressively realized the SkyBiome was doomed. That is why elves are rarer than most other species.
3. CoreBiome (underground)
    Those who dwelled in the CoreBiome heard of what was going on in the MotherBiome and cut themselves off. Only a portion of the radiation reached the Core Biome, and the appearence of magic was also slower. By the time the SkyCities started falling and causing earthquakes, the CorePeoples had become the modern day dwarves. Due to the earthquakes they migrated back to the surface and started living either in the MotherBiome or their very shallowest caves.
4. OceanBiome (underwater)
    When the MotherBiome fell, the OceanBiome was not yet self-sufficient so they quickly returned to the MotherBiome and mixed in to become Post-Apocalypsers.
5. SpaceBiome (moon)
    When the SpacePeoples heard of the fall of the MotherBiome they cut themselves off in their self-sufficient colonies on the terraformed moon. (This humorously means that it would be lore-consistent to have an alien invasion in a fantasy setting, unless the SpacePeoples didn't survive who knows?)

It took 1000 years for
    the radiation to clear
    the magic to become set in the world
    the Post-Apocalypser species to become distinct
    the SkyCities to start falling
    the CorePeoples (now dwarves) to return to the surface

Thus, in 1100 NA8, known history begins.
